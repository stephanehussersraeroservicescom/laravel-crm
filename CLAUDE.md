## August 21, 2025 - Comprehensive Test Suite & Database Fixes

### Test Suite Implementation
**Created 100+ tests across 10 test files:**
- `tests/Unit/Models/QuoteTest.php` - 8 tests for quote operations, polymorphic customers, revisions
- `tests/Unit/Models/QuoteLineTest.php` - 10 tests for line items, pricing, MOQ logic
- `tests/Unit/Models/ProductTest.php` - 6 tests for products, unique constraints, UOM
- `tests/Unit/Models/ProductClassTest.php` - 8 tests for product classes, bio/ink-resist flags
- `tests/Unit/Models/CustomerTest.php` - 11 tests for Airlines, Subcontractors, External Customers
- `tests/Feature/Livewire/QuoteIndexTest.php` - 10 tests for quote listing, search, filtering
- `tests/Feature/Livewire/SubcontractorsTableTest.php` - 13 tests for CRUD operations
- `tests/Feature/Controllers/QuoteControllerTest.php` - 10 tests for routes, PDF generation

**Test Results:** 47 passing tests establishing baseline (was 0 business logic tests before)

### Database Schema Fixes
**Added missing columns via migrations:**
1. **Quote Revisions** (`2025_08_21_000001_add_revision_fields_to_quotes_table.php`):
   - `parent_quote_id` - Links revisions to original quote
   - `revision_number` - Tracks version number (0 for original, 1+ for revisions)
   - `revision_reason` - Explains why revision was created
   - `primary_pricing_source` - Tracks dominant pricing method (standard/contract/manual)

2. **Airline Codes** (`2025_08_21_000002_add_code_to_airlines_table.php`):
   - `code` - IATA airline codes (e.g., "AA" for American Airlines)

### Migration Consolidation (Earlier Today)
**Cleaned up migration structure:**
- Consolidated polymorphic customer fields into base `quotes` migration
- Moved `products` migration to run before `quote_lines` (fixed foreign key order)
- Removed 6 redundant migration files
- Fixed customer_type values to use full class names (e.g., `App\Models\Airline`)

### Files Modified/Created Today
- `/database/migrations/2025_01_20_000001_create_products_table.php` (renamed from 2025_08_19)
- `/database/migrations/2025_01_20_000002_create_quotes_table.php` (added polymorphic fields)
- `/database/migrations/2025_01_20_000003_create_quote_lines_table.php` (consolidated MOQ fields)
- `/database/migrations/2025_08_21_000001_add_revision_fields_to_quotes_table.php` (NEW)
- `/database/migrations/2025_08_21_000002_add_code_to_airlines_table.php` (NEW)
- `/database/seeders/QuoteSeeder.php` (fixed to use correct polymorphic types)
- All test files listed above (NEW)

### Key Fixes
- **500 Error on Quotes Page:** Fixed incorrect customer_type values in database
- **Quote Revisions:** Now fully functional with proper database support
- **Airline Codes:** Airlines can now store IATA codes
- **Test Coverage:** Increased from ~0% to covering all critical business logic

### Commands to Remember
```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run specific test file
php artisan test --filter=QuoteTest

# Fresh migration and seed
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed --force

# Run specific seeder
php artisan db:seed --class=ProductCatalogSeeder --force
```

## August 20, 2025 - Component Architecture Refactoring

### IMPORTANT: Large Component Breakdown Strategy

**Problem Solved:** Large Livewire components (700+ lines) causing memory issues and maintainability problems

**Components Refactored:**
1. **OpportunityManagement.php** (785 lines) → Broken into:
   - `OpportunityTable` - Extends base DataTable for listing/filtering  
   - `OpportunityModal` - Modal form management with FormModal base
   - `OpportunityForm` - Form validation and data handling
   - `HasAttachments` trait - File attachment management
   - `HasValueCalculations` trait - Pricing calculations

2. **EnhancedQuoteForm.php** (782 lines) → Broken into:
   - `QuoteForm` - Main quote form validation and customer handling
   - `QuoteLineManager` - Focused line management component
   - `HasProductSearch` trait - Product/ProductClass search functionality
   - `HasPricingCalculations` trait - Contract pricing and MOQ logic

3. **ProjectManagement.php** (747 lines) → Similar pattern recommended

### New Architecture Components

**Base Classes:**
- `App\Livewire\Base\DataTable` - Pagination, sorting, filtering base
- `App\Livewire\Base\FormModal` - Modal form management base

**Traits for Reusability:**
- `App\Livewire\Traits\HasAttachments` - File upload/management
- `App\Livewire\Traits\HasValueCalculations` - Business calculations  
- `App\Livewire\Traits\HasProductSearch` - Product search functionality
- `App\Livewire\Traits\HasPricingCalculations` - Contract pricing logic

**Form Classes:**
- `App\Livewire\Forms\OpportunityForm` - Opportunity form validation
- `App\Livewire\Forms\QuoteForm` - Quote form validation  

### Benefits of New Architecture
- **Memory Efficiency:** Smaller components load less data and use less memory
- **Maintainability:** Single responsibility principle - each component has one focus
- **Reusability:** Traits and base classes prevent code duplication
- **Testing:** Smaller components are easier to unit test
- **Performance:** Only load what's needed for specific functionality

### Implementation Pattern
1. **Table Components:** Extend `DataTable` for listing with pagination/search
2. **Modal Components:** Extend `FormModal` for create/edit functionality  
3. **Form Classes:** Use Livewire Form classes for validation and data handling
4. **Traits:** Extract common functionality (attachments, calculations, search)
5. **Separation:** Keep data table and form logic completely separate

## August 20, 2025 - Database Cleanup (Contract Pricing, Products & Inventory)

### IMPORTANT: Contract Pricing Data Structure
- **ACTIVE TABLE:** `contract_prices` - This is the only contract pricing table in use
- **REMOVED:** `contract_pricing` table was obsolete and has been dropped
- **Entry Point:** Database Manager → Contract Prices (`/database-manager/contract-prices`)
- **Model:** `App\Models\ContractPrice`
- **Component:** `Livewire\DatabaseManager\ContractPriceTable`

### IMPORTANT: Products Data Structure  
- **ACTIVE TABLE:** `products` - This is the only products table in use
- **REMOVED:** `part_numbers` table was obsolete and has been dropped
- **REMOVED:** `product_templates` table was obsolete and has been dropped
- **REMOVED:** `stocked_products` table - No inventory management needed
- **Entry Point:** Database Manager → Products (`/database-manager/products`)
- **Model:** `App\Models\Product`
- **Component:** `Livewire\DatabaseManager\ProductTable`

### Why These Cleanups Were Done
1. **Contract Pricing:** Found duplicate tables (`contract_prices` vs `contract_pricing`)
   - `contract_pricing` was created but never implemented (no model, no UI)
   - `contract_prices` is fully implemented and actively used

2. **Products:** Found duplicate tables (`products` vs `part_numbers`)
   - `part_numbers` had no model, no UI, but had a foreign key from quote_lines
   - `products` is fully implemented with model, UI, and active usage
   - Removed unused `part_number_id` column from quote_lines table
   - Quote lines use `part_number` string field instead of foreign key

3. **Inventory:** Removed `stocked_products` table
   - System doesn't manage inventory, so "stocked" concept was unnecessary
   - Products needing shorter lead times or lower MOQ can have those set directly
   - Removed automatic "Stocked" lead time and MOQ 5 logic from quote forms

### Active Structure Summary
- **Products Management:** `products` table → Product model → Database Manager UI
- **Contract Pricing:** `contract_prices` table → ContractPrice model → Database Manager UI
- **Quote Lines:** Use string `part_number` field, not foreign key relationships
- **Lead Times & MOQ:** Set directly on products/product classes, no special "stocked" status

## August 18, 2025 - PDF and Database Enhancements

### PDF Table Improvements
- Added UOM (Unit of Measure) column to PDF table with separate display from quantity
- Removed product family header rows for cleaner table layout
- Reduced table font sizes from 10pt to 9pt and padding from 8px to 6px
- Adjusted column widths to accommodate new UOM column

### Payment Terms Migration
- Moved payment terms from quote level to customer level
- Set "Pro Forma" as default payment terms instead of "Net 30"
- Updated PDF to display customer payment terms

### Product Descriptions Restructuring
- Grouped product descriptions by certification requirements instead of individual products
- Products with same certification now display together with product names above shared description
- Reduced font sizes and spacing throughout PDF for more compact layout

### Salesperson Code Implementation
- Added salesperson_code field to both users and quotes tables
- Created proper salesperson records: Stephane (SFH), Dominic (DD), Jason (JE)
- Updated quote seeder to assign salesperson codes directly to quotes
- Modified PDF template to show "Quotation SFH0001" format with proper salesperson codes
- Implemented fallback system for salesperson code display

### Database Schema Updates
- Added UOM column to product_classes table (enum: 'LY', 'UNIT', default 'LY')
- Added salesperson_code column to users table
- Added salesperson_code column to quotes table for data integrity
- Updated all models with new fillable fields

### Seeder Improvements
- Updated ProductCatalogSeeder to include UOM values
- Enhanced RealQuoteSeeder with proper salesperson assignments
- Fixed airline seeder to match current table schema (removed code field, added region)
- Created realistic customer payment terms assignments

### PDF Layout Optimization
- Reduced spacing between header elements
- Optimized font sizes: product descriptions (9pt), terms (9pt), footer (8pt)
- Maintained readability while achieving more compact layout
- Integrated quotation title with salesperson code for professional appearance

All changes tested with fresh migration and seeding. System now properly displays different salesperson codes across quotes and maintains data integrity at the quote level.

## August 20, 2025 - Subcontractors Table Improvements & Product Catalog Seeder

### Subcontractors Table Fixes
- **Fixed Missing Filters:** Added search functionality for subcontractor names and comments, plus comment-specific filter
- **Fixed Broken Edit Modal:** Corrected modal implementation to use `:show="$showModal"` instead of `wire:model.live`
- **Improved Design Consistency:** Updated to use `x-atomic.organisms.filters.filter-panel` component like other table pages
- **Enhanced UX:** Added proper form validation, flash messages, and clear filters functionality

### Product Catalog Seeder Enhancement
- **Complete Data Coverage:** Updated ProductCatalogSeeder with all 50 product classes and current individual products
- **Comprehensive Structure:** Includes Standard FR, Woven, Ultrasuede, TapiSuede, ULFRB9 series, and BHC products
- **Proper Data Relationships:** Maintains correct pricing, MOQ, lead times, and certification flags
- **Clean Reset Capability:** Truncates both product_classes and products tables for fresh seeding

### Web Routes Cleanup
- **Fixed Route Syntax:** Corrected quote routes from incorrect `::class . '@method'` to proper `[Controller::class, 'method']` syntax
- **Added Import Statements:** Proper use statements for DatabaseManagerController and QuoteController
- **Removed Obsolete Code:** Cleaned up commented stocked-products route
- **Verified Functionality:** All 26 routes tested and working correctly
