## 2025-07-20: Project Roadmap Discussion

### User Request
Three major undertakings identified:
1. Add a quoting module (barebone already exists on GitHub, will interact with existing login/users)
2. Integration of AI and voice recognition to enhance CRM functionality
3. Double-check that all refactoring is optimized after recent changes

### Decision
**Recommended starting with optimization** for the following reasons:
- **Solid Foundation**: Ensure current codebase is stable and performant before adding new features
- **Fresh Context**: Just completed major refactoring, issues are fresh in memory
- **Prevent Technical Debt**: Adding features on unoptimized code compounds problems
- **Easier Integration**: Clean code makes integrating quoting module and AI features smoother

### Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1: Optimization** (Current)
   - Audit codebase for optimization opportunities
   - Fix N+1 query issues
   - Review component architecture consistency
   - Verify all CRUD operations
   - Test performance bottlenecks

2. **Phase 2: Quoting Module Integration** (Next)
   - Integrate existing barebone quoting module from GitHub
   - Connect with current authentication system
   - Ensure seamless user experience

3. **Phase 3: AI & Voice Recognition** (Future)
   - Implement AI features for CRM enhancement
   - Add voice recognition capabilities
   - Create intelligent assistance features

### Branch Strategy
- Created `optimization` branch from `main` for all optimization work
- Will create separate branches for quoting module and AI features

- Initial tasks identified:
  1. Database query optimization (N+1 issues)
  2. Component reusability audit
  3. Error handling review
  4. Performance testing
  5. Code duplication removal
  6. Test coverage analysis
